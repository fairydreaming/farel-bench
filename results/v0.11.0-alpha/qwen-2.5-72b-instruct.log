3. **Kayla is Sean's parent.**

From these relationships:
- Kayla is Angela's grandparent (since Kayla is Alice's parent and Alice is Angela's parent).
- Kayla is Sean's parent.

Therefore, Sean is Angela's sibling (since they both have Kayla as a parent).

However, we need to check if there are any other relationships that might affect this conclusion. Let's review the other given relationships:

5. **Nancy is Jordan's parent.**
6. **Beverly is David's parent.**
7. **Jennifer is Kayla's parent.**

- Eugene is the parent of William and the parent of Steven.
- Steven is the parent of Mark.
- Mark is the parent of Bobby.
- Bobby is the parent of Nathan.
- William is the parent of Madison.

Now, focusing on Julia and Steven:

Now, let's focus on the relationship between Gloria and Christopher:

- Gloria is Brittany's child.
- Brittany is Andrew's child.
- Amber is Brittany's child and Christopher's parent.
- Christopher is Amber's child.

Since Gloria is Brittany's child and Brittany is Andrew's child, Gloria is Andrew's grandchild. Christopher is Amber's child, and Amber is Brittany's child, making Christopher Brittany's grandchild. Therefore, Gloria and Christopher are both grandchildren of Andrew, which means they are first cousins.

To determine Willie's relationship to Bryan, let's map out the family tree based on the given relationships:

1. Carl is Laura's parent.
2. Susan is Henry's parent.
3. Bryan is Carl's parent.
4. Amy is Bryan's parent.
5. Laura is Daniel's parent.
6. Willie is Susan's parent.
7. Susan is Amy's parent.
8. Amy is Debra's parent.
9. Debra is Jose's parent.

From these relationships, we can establish the following family tree:

- Amy (parent of Bryan, Susan, and Debra)
  - Bryan (parent of Carl)
    - Carl (parent of Laura)
      - Laura (parent of Daniel)
  - Susan (parent of Henry)
    - Henry
  - Debra (parent of Jose)
    - Jose

- Willie is Amy's parent.
- Amy is Bryan's parent.
- Therefore, Willie is Bryan's grandparent.

Since the options provided are:
1. Willie is Bryan's aunt or uncle.
2. Willie is Bryan's great grandparent.
3. Willie is Bryan's niece or nephew.
4. Willie is Bryan's great grandchild.

The correct answer is that Willie is Bryan's grandparent, but the closest option provided is:
