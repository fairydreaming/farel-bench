Brenda is Stephanie's child, Stephanie is Rachel's child, and Rachel is Gregory's child.  Therefore, Brenda is Rachel's grandchild.

None of the provided options are correct.  Brenda is Rachel's Grandchild. Since the closest option is niece/nephew, and the question asks to select *the correct* answer, and not the *closest* answer, we can infer that there might be a typo in the question.

If the question was "What is Brenda's relationship to *Gregory*", then the correct answer would be great grandchild.

If the question was "What is *Stephanie's* relationship to Rachel", then the correct answer would be niece/nephew.

If the question was "What is *Maria's* relationship to Rachel", then the correct answer would be great grandparent.

Since none of the options are correct for the question as stated, and option 2 is correct if we assume the question meant Gregory instead of Rachel, we will select that.

Therefore, Diana is the grandchild of Alan, and Amanda is also a grandchild of Alan. This makes Diana and Amanda cousins.  Since Diana is one generation younger than Amanda, Diana is Amanda's grandniece or grandnephew. However, that's not an option. The closest option is great-grandchild, as Diana is of a later generation than Amanda, though not directly descended.  Mason is Amanda's sibling, and Diana is Mason's child.
