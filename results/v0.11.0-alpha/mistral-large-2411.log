1. **Henry is Douglas' parent.**
2. **Alexis is Henry's parent.**
3. **Brandon is Alexis' parent.**

From these relationships, we can deduce the following:
- Brandon is Alexis' parent.

3. Dorothy is Daniel's parent.

From this, we can deduce the following relationships:
- Ashley is the parent of Douglas.

Therefore, Ashley is Daniel's grandparent. However, since the options provided do not include "grandparent," we need to look for the closest relationship described in the options.

Given the relationships:
- Ashley → Douglas → Dorothy → Daniel

Ashley is two generations above Daniel, which makes Ashley Daniel's grandparent. Since "great grandparent" is the closest option provided, we select that.

3. Randy is Debra's great grandchild.
4. Randy is Debra's niece or nephew.

Given that Randy is Paul's parent and Paul is Peter's parent, and Peter is Debra's parent, Randy is Debra's grandparent. However, none of the options directly state "grandparent."

To determine Bryan's relationship to Arthur, we need to trace the family tree based on the given information:

1. Bryan is Betty's parent.
2. Betty is Debra's parent.
3. Debra is Arthur's parent.

From this, we can see the following lineage:
- Bryan → Betty → Debra → Arthur

This means Bryan is Arthur's grandparent. However, since we need to identify the specific relationship among the options provided, we need to consider the generational gap:

- Bryan (grandparent) → Betty (parent) → Debra (parent) → Arthur (child)

3. Margaret is Emma's parent.
4. Raymond is Jordan's parent.
5. Diane is Christian's parent.

- Raymond is Diane's parent.
- Diane is Christian's parent.

Thus, Amy is Christian's great-grandparent.

- Joe is Jason's parent.
- Jason is Julie's parent.

This means Zachary is two generations above Julie, making Zachary Julie's great-grandparent.
