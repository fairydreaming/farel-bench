To determine Eric's relationship to Thomas, let's map out the family relationships step by step.

1. **Thomas is Vincent's parent.**
   - Thomas is the parent of **Vincent**.

2. **Vincent is Eric's parent.**
   - Vincent is the parent of **Eric**.

From statements 1 and 2:
- **Thomas → Vincent → Eric**
- This means Thomas is Eric's **grandparent**.

3. **Theresa is Kayla's parent.**
   - Theresa is the parent of **Kayla**.

4. **Kevin is Theresa's parent.**
   - Kevin is the parent of **Theresa**.

5. **Theresa is Thomas's parent.**
   - Theresa is the parent of **Thomas**.

From statements 3, 4, and 5:
- **Kevin → Theresa → Thomas and Kayla**
- This means Thomas and Kayla are **siblings** (they share the same parent, Theresa).

However, since the question asks about Eric's relationship to **Thomas**, we focus on the direct lineage:
- **Thomas (grandparent) → Vincent (parent) → Eric (child)**

Therefore, **Eric is Thomas's grandchild**.

To determine Kyle's relationship to David based on the given family relationships, let's reconstruct the family tree step by step:

1. **Dennis is David's parent.**
   - This means Dennis is the father or mother of David.
   
2. **Dennis is Kyle's parent.**
   - This means Dennis is also the father or mother of Kyle.
   
   From points 1 and 2, since both David and Kyle share the same parent (Dennis), they are **siblings**.

3. **Shirley is Dennis's parent.**
   - Shirley is the parent of Dennis, making Shirley the grandparent of both David and Kyle.
   
4. **David is Jack's parent.**
   - David is the parent of Jack.
   
5. **Jack is Bobby's parent.**
   - Jack is the parent of Bobby.

- **Shirley**
  - **Dennis**
    - **David**
      - **Jack**
        - **Bobby**

2. Julie is Brandon's parent.
3. Jason is Thomas' parent.
4. Nathan is George's parent.
5. Bradley is Scott's parent.
6. Larry is Nathan's parent.
7. Thomas is Julie's parent.
8. Scott is Larry's parent.
9. Larry is Jason's parent.

**Building the family tree:**

- **Bradley** is **Scott's** parent.
  - **Scott** is **Charles'** parent.
  - **Scott** is **Larry's** parent.
    - **Larry** is **Nathan's** parent.
      - **Nathan** is **George's** parent.
    - **Larry** is **Jason's** parent.
      - **Jason** is **Thomas'** parent.
        - **Thomas** is **Julie’s** parent.
          - **Julie** is **Brandon’s** parent.

From the tree:
- **Brandon** is the child of **Julie**.
- **Julie** is the child of **Thomas**.
- **Thomas** is the child of **Jason**.

This means **Brandon** is **Jason's great-grandchild**, making **Jason** the great-grandparent of **Brandon**.

**Therefore, Brandon's relationship to Jason is that of a great-grandchild.**

To determine Nicole's relationship to Lawrence, we'll map out the family relationships step by step based on the given information.

1. **Starting with Charles's Parents and Children:**
   - **Bradley** is **Charles's** parent. So, Bradley → Charles.
   - **Charles** is the parent of both **Kimberly** and **Nicole**. So, Charles → Kimberly and Charles → Nicole.
  
   This means:
   - **Kimberly** and **Nicole** are siblings (children of Charles).
   - **Bradley** is their grandparent.

2. **Kimberly's Children:**
   - **Kimberly** is the parent of **Lawrence** and **Rebecca**. So, Kimberly → Lawrence and Kimberly → Rebecca.
  
   This means:
   - **Lawrence** and **Rebecca** are siblings (children of Kimberly).
   - **Nicole** (Kimberly's sister) is their **aunt**.

3. **Extended Relationships:**
   - **Rebecca** is the parent of **Jordan**. So, Rebecca → Jordan.
   - **Lawrence** is the parent of **Edward**. So, Lawrence → Edward.
   - **Edward** is the parent of **Amanda**. So, Edward → Amanda.
   - **Amanda** is the parent of **Karen**. So, Amanda → Karen.

4. **Understanding Nicole and Lawrence's Relationship:**
   - Since **Nicole** is the sister of **Kimberly** and **Kimberly** is **Lawrence's** mother, **Nicole** is **Lawrence's aunt**.

Therefore, **Nicole is Lawrence's aunt or uncle**, which corresponds to option **2**.

To solve this problem, we'll construct a family tree based on the given relationships:

1. **Elijah** is **Julia**'s parent.
2. **Julia** is **Aaron** and **Roy**'s parent.
3. **Aaron** is **Catherine** and **Bradley**'s parent.
4. **Catherine** is **Jerry**'s parent.
5. **Jerry** is **Ann**'s parent.
6. **Ann** is **Danielle**'s parent.

```

From the tree, we can see:

- **Jose** is the father of **Raymond** and **Jason**, making **Jason** and **Raymond** siblings.
- **Raymond** is the father of **Katherine**, making **Katherine** the niece of **Jason** (since **Jason** is the brother of **Raymond**).
- Therefore, **Jason** is **Katherine**'s **uncle**.

2. **Christian's children:**

   - **Christian** is the parent of both **Joseph** and **Samuel**.
     - *Christian → Joseph*
     - *Christian → Samuel*
     - This makes **Joseph** and **Samuel** siblings.

3. **Samuel's descendants:**

   - **Samuel** is **Henry**'s parent.
     - *Samuel → Henry*
     - As **Samuel** and **Joseph** are siblings, **Henry** is **Joseph**'s niece or nephew.

4. **Henry's descendants:**

   - **Henry** is **Debra**'s parent.
     - *Henry → Debra*

To solve this problem, let's analyze the family relationships step by step and build a family tree.

1. **Andrew is Brittany's parent.**
   - Andrew is the parent of Brittany.

2. **Brittany is Amber's parent.**
   **Brittany is Gloria's parent.**
   - Brittany is the parent of both Amber and Gloria.
   - Therefore, Amber and Gloria are siblings.

3. **Amber is Christopher's parent.**
   **Amber is Aaron's parent.**
   - Amber is the parent of Christopher and Aaron.
   - Christopher and Aaron are siblings.

4. **Aaron is Joyce's parent.**
   - Aaron is the parent of Joyce.

5. **Christopher is Ronald's parent.**
   - Christopher is the parent of Ronald.

6. **Ronald is Sophia's parent.**
