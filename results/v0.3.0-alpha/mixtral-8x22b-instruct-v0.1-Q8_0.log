<ANSWER>2</ANSWER>

Explanation:

* Richard is Gloria's parent.
* Hannah is Sophia's parent.
* Sophia is Richard's parent. (This means Sophia is Richard's mother, and Hannah is Sophia's husband's mother, making Hannah Richard's grandmother.)
* Carol is Catherine's parent.
* Catherine is Hannah's parent. (This means Catherine is Hannah's daughter, and Carol is Catherine's mother, making Carol Hannah's daughter-in-law.)

Explanation:

* Brandon is Brenda's parent.
* Brenda is Margaret's parent.
* Margaret is Alexander's parent.
* Janet is Brandons parent.
* Janet is Joyce's parent.
* Joyce is Joshua's parent.

So, Joshua is Brandons great grandchild. However, the question asks for Joshua's relationship to Brandon, not Brandons relationship to Joshua. Therefore, Joshua is Brandons great grandchild, but Brandons relationship to Joshua is that of a great grandparent.

Since the options provided are about Joshua's relationship to Brandon, the correct answer is that Joshua is Brandons aunt or uncle. This is because Joshua's parent (Joyce) is the sibling of Janet, who is Brandons parent. Therefore, Joshua is Brandons niece or nephew, but since the options do not include that, the closest correct answer is that Joshua is Brandons aunt or uncle.

However, Elija is also the parent of Bradley. This means that Walter and Bradley are siblings, as they share the same parent (Emily). Therefore, Walter is Bradley's nephew (since Bradley is older).

So, the correct answer is that Walter is Bradley's niece or nephew.
