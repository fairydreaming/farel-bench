**Explanation**:

- Eric is Janet's parent.
- Eric is also Lawrence's parent.
- Lawrence is Richard's parent.

So, Richard is the child of Lawrence, who is the child of Eric, who is Janet's parent. This makes Richard a grandchild of Eric and a great-grandchild of Janet. However, since the relationship is through Eric, who is a common ancestor, Richard would be considered Janet's great grandchild.

The other options are incorrect because:

1. Richard is not in the same generation as Janet's nieces or nephews.
2. Richard is younger than Janet, so he cannot be her great grandparent.
4. Richard is not in the same generation as Janet's grandchildren.

- Lori is Heather's parent (from point 2).
- Heather is Stephen's parent (from point 3).
- Stephen is Kevin's parent (from point 8).

So, Kevin is Lori's grandchild. However, none of the given options match this relationship. The closest option is "Kevin is Lori's niece or nephew" (option 4), which would be true if Lori were Kevin's aunt or uncle. In this case, the family tree is a bit confusing, but option 4 is the closest answer.
