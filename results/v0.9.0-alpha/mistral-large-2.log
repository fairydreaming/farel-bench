- Charles is Diana's parent.

Therefore, Heather is Diana's grandparent.

However, since the question asks for the relationship in terms of "great grandparent," "aunt or uncle," "niece or nephew," or "great grandchild," we need to determine the closest fitting relationship.

Given that Heather is two generations above Diana (Heather -> Susan -> Charles -> Diana), Heather is Diana's grandparent. However, since "grandparent" is not an option, we need to consider the closest fitting relationship among the options provided.
