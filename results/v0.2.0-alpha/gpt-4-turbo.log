Given the options:
1. Charlotte is Ronald's aunt or uncle.
2. Charlotte is Ronald's great grandparent.
3. Charlotte is Ronald's niece or nephew.

- John is Kevin's parent.
Thus, Rachel is Kevin's grandparent.

Since Rachel is Terry's parent (from point 6), and Rachel is also Kevin's grandparent:
- Terry is Kevin's child.

Therefore, Kevin is Terry's parent. However, this relationship is not listed in the options provided. Let's reevaluate the relationships to ensure accuracy:

- Rachel is Terry's parent.
- Rachel is also John's parent.
- John is Kevin's parent.

Thus, Kevin is Terry's sibling. However, this relationship is also not listed in the options provided. The closest relationships in the options that might have been misinterpreted are:
- Kevin is Terry's niece or nephew (which would imply Kevin is a generation below Terry, but this is incorrect as they are siblings or of the same generation).

Given the options and the relationships:
- Kevin is the child of John.
- John is the child of Rachel.
- Rachel is the parent of Terry.

Thus, Kevin is the grandchild of Rachel, and Terry is the child of Rachel. This makes Kevin the nephew of Terry (if we consider gender-neutral terms, nephew can include both nephew and niece).
